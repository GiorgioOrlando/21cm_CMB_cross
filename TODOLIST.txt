TO DO LIST:

- the code calculates primordial and secondary contribution 21-1-CMB bispectra <21_{l1}-21_{l2}-CMB_{l3}> at z= 30, 50, 100. Also, it makes a Fisher-forecast neglecting secondaries
(which are subdominant), and compute the bias due to secondaries (which is small). CMB is either T or E. 

- the code takes ultra-squeezed triangular configurations with l3<11, and so l1 sim l2 \in [10^4, 10^5]. 
Higher l3's do not contribute significantly to SNR (checked).

- the secondaries bispectra (eq. 37) are calculated taking only the I1 term, eq. 38. In principle also eq. 39 gives a non-neglicible contribution. However, 
calculating it is high-cpu expensive. Neglecting it should not give significant modifications, qualitatively everything should remain the same, 
but it is not "exact exact", of course. Finding a way to include it in the calculation of secondaries would give exact result. I3 and I4 are instead 
neglicible. 

- Finding a way to include more red-shifts in the analysis would give exact results when considering the tomography of the 21-cm 
(even tough really the red-shift dependence of the forecasts is small, so this is not very important...)

- the computation of SNR/secondary Fisher for red-shift slices take 1hour-2hours. Due to conditions on the momenta configuration I could't parallelize
the code (at least, I do not packages that run in parallel function-idexes subjet to conditions between them (also, considering that I really 
want to avoid summing over all the l1, l2's. I really want all the l2's values given a l1 value). 
If something can be done in this regards it would be super.
